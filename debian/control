Description: Cloud broker CompatibleOne Accords Platform (Base Files)
 CompatibleOne is an open source project which provides a model,
 CORDS (CompatibleOne Resource Description Schema), and a platform,
 ACCORDS (Advanced Capabilities for CompatibleOne Resource Distribution
 Services), for the description and federation of different clouds comprising
 resources provisioned by heterogeneous cloud service providers.
 CompatibleOne's flexible service architecture makes it independent from any
 Cloud Service Provider (from OpenStack to OpenNebula, from Azure to Vcloud)
 and can address all types of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS,
 XaaS, BpaaS,... ) and any type of cloud service deployment (public, private,
 community and hybrid).
 The goals of CompatibleOne are to:
   - Provide entrepreneurs and organisations unimpeded access to cloud
     technologies
   - Provide innovative platform of services, that go beyond the standard
     services provided by existing cloud providers
   - Remove the constraints of vendor lock-in
   - Provide a platform that the community can evolve rapidly and adapt
     according to their needs

 server and client endpoints. The exchange of Certificates between
 communicating endpoints is strongly encouraged.
 Authentication of processes and users must be performed through an identity
 management system and will result in authorization being accorded for access
 to the platform and its components.
